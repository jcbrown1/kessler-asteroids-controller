# kessler-asteroids-controller
Genetic algorithm optimized fuzzy tree to play the kessler-game implemented by Thales Group

# How to Setup:
Go to the releases page
https://github.com/ThalesGroup/kessler-game/releases

install V1.3.6

pip install the extracted folder

You will also need some basic scientific computing libraries (numpy, scikit-fuzzy, etc) but the list is going to change often

# TODO

1. Implement a fuzzy-tree
2. Create testing function to evaluate performance of a controller
   - 5 runs, average the score (number of killed asteroids)
3. Re-do parts of fuzzy tree to be genetic so we can train this bitch
